%% Function: start(Type, StartArgs) -> {ok, Pid} |
%%                                     {ok, Pid, State} |
%%                                     {error, Reason}
%% Description: This function is called whenever an application 
%% is started using application:start/1,2, and should start the processes
%% of the application. If the application is structured according to the
%% OTP design principles as a supervision tree, this means starting the
%% top supervisor of the tree.
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
start(_Type, StartArgs) ->
    Ret = case s_supervisor:start_link(StartArgs) of
        {ok, Pid} -> 
            {ok, Pid};
        Error ->
            Error
    end,
    io:format("Application return: ~p~n", [Ret]),
    Ret.

%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function: stop(State) -> void()
%% Description: This function is called whenever an application
%% has stopped. It is intended to be the opposite of Module:start/2 and
%% should do any necessary cleaning up. The return value is ignored. 
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
stop(_State) ->
